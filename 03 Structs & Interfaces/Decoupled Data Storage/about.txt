Decoupled data storage is an architectural approach where data storage is separated from the application logic and business processes.
This code demonstrates a clear separation between the core database service and the underlying data storage mechanisms,
making CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations independent of how the data is actually stored.

By decoupling storage from the main service, the program ensures that records can be managed seamlessly,
without taking into consideration how the data is stored -
(in this implementation we're using a hash map and a doubly linked list).
This approach not only enhances the flexibility and maintainability of the code
but also makes it easier to swap out storage implementations or expand functionality in the future.
